	<!--about news-->

		<p>Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, held one year apart, were designed as a voter outreach and an exercise to build Rahul Gandhi’s image. In the constituencies along the route of the two yatras, the Congress and its current INDIA bloc allies — many of whom had contested on their own in 2019 — gained 41 seats.</p>

		<p>During the first yatra — from September 2022 to January 2023 — Rahul Gandhi addressed 12 public meetings, more than 100 street-corner meetings, and 13 press conferences. He covered over 4,000 km across 75 districts and 71 Lok Sabha constituencies in 12 states and two Union territories.</p>

		<p>The yatra, which started from Kanyakumari and ended in Kashmir, passed through 71 Lok Sabha constituencies, of which the Congress contested 56 seats and won 23 this time. In 2019, it contested 65 of these seats and won 15. Meanwhile, the Congress’s INDIA bloc allies were in the fray in 14 of these seats this time and bagged six.</p>
