		<!--detail about news-->

			<p>Five tractors are stationed on the bed of a dry Yamuna. Ten workers and their supervisors stand around as the tractor beds are filled with sludge and sand. Some are placing sandbags, whose count they have lost track of, along the banks to make sure that when the river is alive again in around a month, the embankment is not breached.</p>

			<p>Nearly a year after the water level of the Yamuna breached the 208-metre mark to give way to the worst-ever recorded flood in 45 years in Delhi, since 1978, work to desilt the area around the ITO Barrage is on at a frenetic pace.</p>

			<p>Last year’s floods forced more than 25,000 people to leave their homes along the floodplains and move to relief camps. Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants were shut and Delhi faced a serious drinking water shortage. Areas near ITO, Ring Road, Kashmere Gate, Old Delhi, Civil Lines, and East Delhi were inundated within a day; water surrounded the Red Fort and even reached the doorstep of the Supreme Court. In the middle of all this was the ITO Barrage with five jammed gates which the Indian Navy and its divers opened after a month-long operation.</p>
